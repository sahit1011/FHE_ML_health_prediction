# FHE-ML Secure Health Prediction - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to build the secure health prediction demo using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Machine Learning (ML).

**Goal:** To create a demonstration comparing a standard plaintext ML prediction service with an FHE-based service, highlighting the privacy advantages of FHE for sensitive health data.

**Core Technologies:**
*   **FHE Library:** Concrete-ML (chosen for its focus on simplifying FHE for ML tasks)
*   **ML Library:** scikit-learn (for training the initial plaintext model)
*   **Language:** Python
*   **UI (Optional but Recommended):** Streamlit or Flask (for a user-friendly demo interface)
*   **Environment Management:** `venv` or `conda`

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   [ ] Create a project directory.
    *   [ ] Set up a Python virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`).
    *   [ ] Install necessary base libraries: `numpy`, `scikit-learn`.
    *   [ ] Install `concrete-ml`.
    *   [ ] Install UI library (`streamlit` or `flask`) if chosen.
    *   [ ] Create `requirements.txt`.

2.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   [ ] Define simple features for health prediction (e.g., Age, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, Blood Sugar Level).
    *   [ ] Generate a small, synthetic dataset (`.csv` file) representing individuals with these features and a binary risk outcome (0 = Low Risk, 1 = High Risk). Ensure a balance between classes if possible.
    *   [ ] Create a script (`data_generator.py`) to generate or load this data.

3.  **Plaintext Model Training:**
    *   [ ] Create a script (`train_plaintext_model.py`).
    *   [ ] Load the synthetic dataset.
    *   [ ] Split data into training and testing sets.
    *   [ ] Choose and train a simple scikit-learn classifier (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, or a small `MLPClassifier`). *Start simple (Logistic Regression is often easiest for FHE conversion).*
    *   [ ] Evaluate the plaintext model's accuracy on the test set.
    *   [ ] Save the trained scikit-learn model (e.g., using `joblib` or `pickle`).

4.  **FHE Model Compilation (Concrete-ML):**
    *   [ ] Create a script (`compile_fhe_model.py`).
    *   [ ] Load the *training* data (needed for quantization calibration in Concrete-ML).
    *   [ ] Load the *saved plaintext model*.
    *   [ ] Use `concrete.ml.sklearn` module to convert/compile the scikit-learn model into an FHE-compatible model. This involves specifying the input data characteristics (e.g., range, bit width) for quantization.
    *   [ ] Save the compiled FHE model components (circuit, keys, etc.) to disk. Document the necessary components.

5.  **Develop Core Logic (Client & Server Simulation):**
    *   [ ] Create a script (`fhe_prediction_service.py` or similar) to simulate the server-side logic:
        *   [ ] Function to load the compiled FHE model.
        *   [ ] Function `run_fhe_prediction(encrypted_input)`: Takes encrypted data, performs FHE inference using the loaded model, returns encrypted result.
    *   [ ] Create a script (`client_app.py` or integrate into UI) for client-side logic:
        *   [ ] Function `generate_keys()`: Generates the FHE public/private key pair for the client. (Note: Concrete-ML often simplifies key management).
        *   [ ] Function `encrypt_data(data, public_key)`: Takes user input (health metrics), encrypts it using the public key.
        *   [ ] Function `decrypt_result(encrypted_result, private_key)`: Decrypts the result received from the server.

6.  **Build Demo Interface (e.g., using Streamlit):**
    *   [ ] Create the main application script (e.g., `app.py`).
    *   [ ] Design UI layout with two sections: "Plaintext Prediction" and "FHE Prediction".
    *   [ ] **Plaintext Section:**
        *   Input fields for health metrics.
        *   "Predict" button.
        *   On click: Send raw data to a simulated "plaintext server" function.
        *   Display the raw data received by the "server".
        *   Display the plaintext prediction result.
    *   [ ] **FHE Section:**
        *   Input fields for health metrics.
        *   "Generate Keys" button (if needed, or handle automatically).
        *   "Encrypt and Predict" button.
        *   On click: Encrypt input data locally.
        *   Display the *ciphertext* being sent to the "server".
        *   Call the `run_fhe_prediction` function (simulating server).
        *   Display the *encrypted* result received from the "server".
        *   Decrypt the result locally.
        *   Display the final decrypted prediction.
    *   [ ] Add clear explanations comparing the two processes, focusing on data visibility at the "server".
    *   [ ] Add notes on potential performance differences (FHE will be slower).

7.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   [ ] Test the end-to-end flow for both plaintext and FHE paths.
    *   [ ] Verify that the decrypted FHE prediction is reasonably close to the plaintext prediction (allow for small differences due to quantization).
    *   [ ] Debug any issues with data types, encryption/decryption, or model execution.
    *   [ ] Improve UI clarity and explanations based on testing.

8.  **Documentation (README Update):**
    *   [ ] Update `README.md` with final setup instructions, how to run the demo, explanation of the project structure, and interpretation of the results.
    *   [ ] Include the generated `requirements.txt`.
